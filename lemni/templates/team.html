    <h1>Our Team</h1>

    <p><strong>Ralph Vince, Lead Developer and Visionary</strong><br>
    Ralph Vince is a Charles H. Dow Award winner. He has worked for fund managers, sovereign wealth funds and family offices around the world since the early 1980s. He was Larry Williams' programmer and trader during Williams' 1987 legendary championship run where he traded $10,000 to over $1,100,000 in a 12-month competition. He has served on the Board of Directors of the Market Technician's Association of New York, and has written numerous books published by John Wiley & Sons as well as professional papers on financial as well as general mathematics and statistics. 
    <br><br>
    He was one of the early pioneers of 3-dimensional CAD systems, natural language processing systems, and was an integral part of the team that created the original Reinberger Hall of Earth & Planetary Exploration at The Cleveland Museum of Natural History.
    <br><br>
    He has worked as a Portfolio Manager at the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and is regarded as a recognized authority on position sizing in trading. His allocation algorithms have been licensed by Dow Jones Indexes. He has been invited to give colloquiums on his ideas at such esteemed institutions as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, The London Chamber of Commerce, and delivered papers at the World Finance Conference, to name a few. Ralph Vince's books and peer-reviewed academic papers on mathematics - often co-authored with the top minds in the field of mathematics - appear in such publications as Mathematics, as well as The Journal of Investment Strategies and The Far East Journal of Theoretical Statistics. His academic writings are among the top 1/2 of 1% of the most read research of all academic writings across all disciplines.
    <br><br>
    Among his most notable and heterodox academic contributions is a means of cryptography spawned by the modular nature of the lemniscate (infinity symbol ∞ ) that is impervious to quantum computer attacks and serves as the basis of a proposed blockchain, wallet, and cryptocurrency, the "Lemnicoin Ecosystem."</p>

    Grant leads LemniChain’s server-side development. With broad expertise across multiple programming languages, he has been instrumental in creating the Python-to-WebAssembly module that enables secure, in-browser key generation and execution of blockchain functions. Grant’s contributions extend beyond code: he ensures the quantum-resistant cryptographic foundation of LemniChain integrates smoothly with modern web frameworks, and he has worked extensively on the Flask back-end, security protocols, and validator tools that power the platform. His focus on performance, scalability, and cryptographic integrity helps guarantee LemniChain’s technical edge in the post-quantum era.</p>
